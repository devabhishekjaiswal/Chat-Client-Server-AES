STEPS TO COMPILE :


1) ChatClient(one to one chat client server) -->
	a) Copy the ChatClient project to NetBeans.
     	b) In the Server Package Compiler ServerTest.java file, you will get a GUI for server side
	c) Then in the Client package compile the ClientTest.java file now you will get the GUI for the client.
	d) In the top portion of the two GUIs you will see a text field type your message, IT will be sent.
	e) You can see the History of chats in the Text Area of each GUI.

2) Multithreaded Chat Client (group chat client server)
	a) Copy the "Multithreaded Chat Client" project to NetBeans.
    	b) In the MultiServer package compile the "Server.java" file.
 	c) In the MulitClient package compile the "ClientTest.java" file as many clients you want.
	d) I have maintained a set of predefined PASSWORDS and USERNAME in the hashmap.
	e) In the client GUI enter the valid password and username and then click on LogIn button.
	f) IMP: valid passwords are: 
			USERNAME 	PASSWORD
			abhishek	456
			a		123
			abc		212
			xyz		123
	g) enter any of the above username and password combination to login successfully.
	h) once you successfully login server will show welcome message, otherwise Unauthorised login message comes.
	i) Enter your message in textfild below login button
	j) PRESS ENTER once you type message in textfield DO NOT PRESS SEND BUTTON.
	k) your message will be then sent to all the clients and server.
	l) You can see all the history of chats in text area present in any server GUI and client GUI.
